"Also, when you try to download a large file, like a video, it will start out normally, downloading at around 600kb/sec and over the course of a couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around 20kb/sec, making a download of a couple minutes into several hours making it worthless."

The first thing I can say for positive is that the laptop is very light- makes it really portable..this with a relatively clear screen is a bonus.
GRAPHICS#QUALITY

Now the graphics are not HD...and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic (medium low grade) plastic.
